# spring-proj-demo

Using a starter project from start.spring.io
Add a business service to serve via API a list of apples. 
Use Google JIB to create and push the container to docker hub. 

Run this in a docker container and then visit http://IPAddress:8080/apples. To exercise the API (GET and POST), use your favorite REST client. I use postman.
